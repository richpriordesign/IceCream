CSS Positioning Example For Learners

## What Is It?
Code I decided to create to help those struggling with CSS Positioning. It corresponds with this tutorial:
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/css-positioning-explained-by-building-an-ice-cream-sundae-831cb884bfa9#.ktcmhhfpd
I felt this tutorial was good but didn't walk people through it enough. 

## How To Use It

Read the article posted above (I have no affiliation with it). This code reflects the article. Check out the comments in the HTML and CSS file to understand the code better. I encourage you to play with the code and resize the browser window height and width and scroll to see how CSS positioning works.
